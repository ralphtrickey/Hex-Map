Version 0.5 pre-Alpha
It will deploye to an iPad and you can move/pinch/zoom/rotate.
I couldn't find anything on the web that demonstrates these techniques.
This is basic code to display a 3D hex grid with textures based on triangle strips.
  It goes up to 50x50 loading them into the GPU.
Includes code to convert from world to screen and screen to world coordinates.
Includes code to do basic gesture recognition (move/pinch/rotate)
I've tested it on an iPad 1, and it seems to work fine.
Marmalade is a commercial cross-platform SDK (www.madewithmarmalade.com)
TODO:
Fix Zoom and Rotate to work around the center of the fingers instead of the center of the screen.
Abstract out the hex contents into a separate class.
  Right now, it just does a fixed terrain.
Abstract out basic counters into a separate class.
  That way I can test out various control schemes to see what works.
Allow for multiple texture maps.
  This would allow for overlays for roads, etc.
Prevent the user from moving the grid off the screen.
Virtualize the map to allow for bigger maps.
Allow it to switch to quads when the map gets too small.
LICENSING
MS-PL. If you feel that's too restrictive, send me an email.
It works on my computer, but I don't make any guarantees.
If you use parts, I'd appreciate mention, or at least a friendly email ;)
